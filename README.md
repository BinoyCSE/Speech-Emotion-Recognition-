# Machine learning project 
## Project-01: Speech Emotion Recognition using MLP Classifier
 - Dataset: RAVDESS
 - Python package: Librosa
 - Machine Learning tasks: Scikit-learn (sklearn)
 - Tool: Jupyter Notebook

#### Librosa
- Audio loading
- Feature extraction (such as MFCCs and spectrograms)
- Audio visualization

#### Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation (Accuracy calculation, confusion matrix)

## Note
- I have worked on 24 actors speech from RAVDESS dataset.
- By changing the path of the dataset in the provided .py file, you can run your code on jupyter notebook as localhost.
